Components Documentation  
Last Updated: July 27, 2015

The `components/` folder holds all the files – HTML, SCSS, and, if required, JavaScript – for the components in Primer. Each component is broken out in its own directory, with the SCSS file being imported into `components.scss`, which is then imported into the main `primer.scss` file.

The current components in Primer are:

- Breadcrumbs
- Buttons
- Cards
- Date (subcomponent)
- Hero
- Notifications
- Modals
