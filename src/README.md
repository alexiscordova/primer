Last Updated: July 7, 2015

The `primer.scss` file is the main import file for all of Primer. This file should not contain anything but `@import` statements, the `$use-grid` variable, and comments. When compiled, this file will be processed into `primer.css` and `primer.min.css` within the `dist/assets/css` directory.

Documentation for each section of Primer is found within their respective directory.
