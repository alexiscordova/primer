Atoms Documentation  
Last Updated: August 11, 2015

The `atoms/` directory holds the atomic elements – the basic building blocks – for Primer. Each SCSS file is imported into `_atoms.scss`, which is then imported into the main `primer.scss` file.

Currently, the atomic elements in Primer consist of:

- Animations
- Badges
- Buttons
- Colors
- Dates
- Inputs
- Links
- Typography
