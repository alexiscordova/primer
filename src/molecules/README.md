Molecules Documentation  
Last Updated: August 11, 2015

The `molecules/` directory holds all the files for the components in Primer. Each molecule is broken out in its own directory, with the SCSS file being imported into `_molecules.scss`, which is then imported into the main `primer.scss` file.

The current molecules in Primer are:

- Breadcrumbs
- Cards
- Geolocation
- Hero
- Modal
- Notifications
